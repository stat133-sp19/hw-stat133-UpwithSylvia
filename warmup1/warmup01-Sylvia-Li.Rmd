## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Cooking Recipe for plush coconut cake

### Ingredients
- 2 cups plus 3 tablespoons (285 grams) all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup (110 grams) coconut oil, warmed just enough to liquefy
- 1 1/2 cups full- or low-fat coconut milk (see Note)
- 1 tablespoon (15 ml) plain vinegar

### Special Kitchen Tools
- parchment paper
- cake pan
- wire rack

### Steps
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Line the bottom of 9-inch round cake pan with a fitted round of parchment paper and coat the bottoms and sides with nonstick cooking spray.

2. Whisk together flour, baking soda, salt and granulated sugar in the bottom of a large mixing bowl. Add coconut oil, coconut milk, and vinegar and whisk until batter is smooth.

3. Pour into prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes [updated to note: it’s sounding in the comments like it’s taking some people a bit longer — it’s not done until the center is set, even if it’s longer than it took me], or until the top is springy and a tester inserted in the center comes out batter-free. Cool the cake in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then cut around it with a knife to ensure it is loosened and flip it out onto a cooling rack to cool the rest of the way.

### Variations

*If you wish to make a glaze*: Whisk together 3/4 cup powdered sugar with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the leftover coconut milk, adding a little at a time, until it is smooth but not too runny. Add a pinch of salt, if you wish. Once cake is fully cool, spread over the top of the cake and smooth to the edges with a knife or small offset spatula, where it will find its way down the sides decoratively on its own. I added some white confetti sprinkles, but toasted coconut chips would be nice here too.

**Note: there is no special season of the year for it!**

## Euclidean Distance

### Definition

---

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\overline {\mathbf {pq}}$).

<br/>In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = ($p_1$,$p_2$,..., $p_n$) and **q** = ($q_1$, $q_2$,..., $q_n$) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:


$$\textit{d}(\textbf{p},\textbf{q}) = \textit{d}(\textbf{q},\textbf{p}) = \sqrt{(q_1 - p_1)^2 + (q_2 - p_2)^2 + \dots + (q_n - p_n)^2}$$


$$= \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(q_i - p_i)^2}. $$ 

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:
$$\| \textbf{p} \| = \sqrt{p_1^2 + p_2^2 + \dots + p_n^2} = \sqrt{\textbf{p·p}},$$
where the last expression involves the dot product.
